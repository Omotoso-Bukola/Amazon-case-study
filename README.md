# Amazon Product Review Analysis Project

## Overview

This report presents a data analysis project conducted on an Amazon product dataset using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights from key product metrics such as prices, ratings, reviews, and discounts, and to visualize them through a structured dashboard. The project involved data cleaning, calculated columns, pivot tables, and interactive elements like slicers to summarize trends and performance across product categories.


## Project Objectives

1. The average discount percentage by product category.
2. How many products are listed under each category. 
3. The total number of reviews per category.  
4. Products with the highest average ratings. 
5. The average actual price vs the discounted price by category. 
6. Products with the highest number of reviews. 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more. 
8. The distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.). 
9. The total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category.
10. The number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, 
   ₹200–₹500, >₹500). 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount. 
12. Products have fewer than 1,000 reviews. 
13. Categories that have products with the highest discounts. 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
